In this project, we tried to reproduce the SVM-based model from the [TrSSP](#prediction-of-membrane-transport-proteins-and-their-substrate-specificities-using-primary-sequence-information-nitish-k-mishrajunil-changpatrick-x-zhao2014) paper, for "Prediction of Membrane Transport Proteins and Their Substrate Specificities"  using python3, Scikit-Learn, Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib (Version information is available in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)). 

Run this [Notebook](notebook.ipynb) for the pipeline details and results.
