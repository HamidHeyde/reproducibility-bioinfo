\begin{acknowledgments}

    First and foremost, I would like to thank my supervisor Dr Tristan Glatard, who supported me 
    throughout my thesis process with his courageous words, patience and knowledge. I consider myself 
    lucky to have such an exceptional and friendly supervisor. A great amount of appreciation to 
    Dr Gregory Butler for his support and help with the initial bioinformatics-related concepts 
    of my work.
    With special thanks to Greg Kiar a Phd student of Dr Tristan Glatard and Munira Alballa a Phd student 
    of Dr Gregory Butler who also helped me out in the process. I would especially like to thank my wife Sophie 
    who has been extremely supportive of me throughout this entire process and has made countless 
    sacrifices to help me get to this point.
