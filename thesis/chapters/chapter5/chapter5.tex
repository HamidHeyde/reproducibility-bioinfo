\chapter{Discussion}
With regards to the sorting and balancing the samples within the dataset 
(section~\ref{sec:modelflex}, Addr: 2), the models produced close results for the balanced and shuffled 
versions of the dataset. But, for highly imbalanced datasets with multiple classes of data, 
these variations could lead to different results. 
A possible scenario with such a dataset with high degree of imbalance is that, if shuffled randomly 
and then split into train and test sets, there is a good chance that the class with the 
least number of instances, would have no representative in the test set. While in the balanced 
version, even the classes with the least amount of samples will always have representatives in the 
test set.
