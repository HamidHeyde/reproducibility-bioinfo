\section{Materials and Methods}

    \subsection{Dataset}   

    The dataset contains 780 transporter proteins classified into 7 substrate specific classes (70 amino acid transporters, 
    60 anion transporters, 260 cation transporters, 60 electron transporters, 70 protein/mRNA transporters, 60 sugar 
    transporters, 200 other transporters) and one none-transporter class (600 proteins) for a total of 1,380 protein 
    sequences which are available at  \trssp{?dowhat=Datasets}{TrSSP} website.\\
    For the purpose of our study, we coded a program (\git{download.py}{download.py}) to download all the sequences from the 
    \ncbi{protein}{NCBI} database using the sequence accession number from TrSSP website. 
    Considering the fact that some sequences could be updated through time, we checked all the \git{dataset/trainTest/}{downloaded ones} 
    against the originals to make sure all of our sequences match those of the TrSSP. We then updated the 
    the modified sequences and their accession numbers accordingly.
