\tbm{FEATURE EXTRACTION}
\tbm{it would be helpful if the authors could share their final generated feature files for
 all or few sequences or any other resources that one could compare the reproduced results with.\\
 So, Any possible computational differences/errors caused by the use of different libraries 
 or approaches could be addressed and solved through the process reproducing the features. \\
 this may not be the case for the problem we are trying to address in this paper (1,380 sequences) 
 but for problems with a great number of elements in the dataset, these differences could 
 lead into notable differences in evaluation metrics (accuracy, Sensitivity, etc.) }
 \tbm{(number of decimals, rounding using numpy or python.)}
 \tbm{i checked my results against some website ...}
