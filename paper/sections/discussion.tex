\TG{Add discussion points you may already have}
\tbm{it would be helpful if the authors could share their final generated feature files for
 all or few sequences or any other resources. So,  one could compare the reproduced results with
 the original ones.}
 \tbm{Discussion over choice of algorithm (distance function) and we chose the closest results to the published one, but best one
 is the one with 8 classes}
 \tbm{Discussion over the difference betwwen Gamma and Cost (one for each class or one for all the classes)}
 \tbm{Discussion over which one make sense or which one should we choose? (thresholding, before voting, after voting)}
 \tbm{Possible Box chart analysis}
 \tbm{Discussion over how svc in scikit learn works (probability vs classification) and which one we chose,
        and which one is the better}
 \tbm {Why we tried also SVC from Scikit-learn, to find a replacement for SVMligth}
 \tbm {How to make it better? feature selection? data transformation?}
 \tbm {Discussion over uncertainty between equivalent models -> precision measure}
 \tbm {Discussion over sequence update, so, version number should be mentioned or provide the original dataset}
 \tbm {is there are any challenges associated with the computation of the features and their reproducibility? explain
 hoe you compared your results. }
 \tbm{when to use scikit prabability based vs confusion matrix based is SVMligth replacebale}
